Singleton design pattern â€“ having a unique instance of a type in the entire program

Example:
    When you want to use the same connection to a database to make every query

    When you open a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to a server to do a few tasks and don't want to reopen the connection for each task

    If you need to limit the access to some variable or space, you use a Singleton as the door to this variable (we'll see in the following chapters that this is moreachievable in Go using channels anyway)

    If you need to limit the number of calls to some places, you create a Singleton instance to make the calls in the accepted window
